                Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows. 
                An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. 
                It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode (so as to occupy the entire screen). 
                The user can switch between the two using the Alt+â†µ Enter key combination. 
                The text mode is unavailable in Windows Vista and later. 
                Starting with Windows 10, however, a native full-screen mode is available.
